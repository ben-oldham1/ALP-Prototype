# ALP-Prototype
Adaptive Learning Platforms Prototype for IT Practice 2 module at UWE Bristol.

# Features
As a prototype application, only certain features have been developed, for demonstration purposes. The most notable of these 
is the AI integration (through OpenAI).

When a student uses the AI to ask for help, it's automatically provided with the context of the app (including the lesson, code and objectives) to best answer their question. 

# Running the code
To run this code yourself, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the project so you have a local copy
2. Create a file in the uppermost project directory called config.py
3. Add your open AI key with the following syntax: `OPENAI_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'`
