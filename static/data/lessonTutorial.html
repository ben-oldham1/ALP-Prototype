    Importing Modules
</h2>
The program starts by importing the random module, which is a built-in Python library used to generate random numbers.

<h2 class="h4">
    Generating a Random Number 
</h2>
secret_number = random.randint(1, 10) generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and stores it in the variable secret_number.

<h2 class="h4">
    User Interaction
</h2>
The program uses print() statements to communicate with the user, providing instructions and feedback based on the user's input.

<h2 class="h4">
    Taking User Input
</h2>
The input() function is used to take the user's guess. It's important to convert this input into an integer using int() since input() returns a string.

<h2 class="h4">
    Conditional Statements
</h2>
The program uses if, elif, and else statements to compare the user's guess with the secret number and provide appropriate feedback.

<h2 class="h4">
    Loop
</h2>
A for loop allows the user to guess up to three times. The loop terminates if the user guesses correctly (break statement) or after three incorrect guesses.
