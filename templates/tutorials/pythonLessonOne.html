<h2 class="h4">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a basic calculator program using Python. The
    calculator will be capable
    of performing four fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
</p>

<h2 class="h4">Step 1: Define Functions</h2>
<p>We'll start by defining four functions - one for each operation: addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, and division.
    These functions will take two numbers as input and return the result of the corresponding
    operation.</p>

<h2 class="h4">Step 2: Main Function</h2>
<p>Next, we'll create a main function where we'll prompt the user to choose an operation and input
    two numbers. Based on
    the user's choice, we'll call the appropriate function and display the result.</p>

<h2 class="h4">Step 3: User Interaction</h2>
<p>Within the main function, we'll provide the user with a list of operations to choose from and
    prompt them to enter
    their choice and the two numbers they want to operate on.</p>

<h2 class="h4">Step 4: Error Handling</h2>
<p>We'll also implement error handling to handle scenarios such as division by zero.</p>
